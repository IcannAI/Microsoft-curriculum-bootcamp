### Data Science for Beginners
##### Quantitative Data
- In a dataset, quantitative data refers to numerical observations that can often be quantified, analysed, and used mathematically. The population of a nation, a person's height, or a company's quarterly profits are a few examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data might be used to determine seasonal variations in the Air Quality Index (AQI) or calculate the probability of rush hour traffic on an average workday.

##### Qualitative Data
- Data that cannot be measured objectively, such as observations of quantitative data, are known as qualitative data, also known as categorical data. 
A product's or process's quality can often be captured using a variety of subjective data types. 
- Like phone numbers or timestamps, some qualitative data can be numerical but not commonly employed mathematically. Qualitative data includes things like video comments, a car's make and model, or the colour that your closest friends like best. Qualitative data may be used to find common job application resume keywords or to determine which items people prefer.
