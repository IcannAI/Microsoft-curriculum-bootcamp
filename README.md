### [Data Science for Beginners]

#### Review of Defining Data
What I have learned in this lesson
- What data is
- How data is described
- How data is classified and categorized
- Where data can be found

##### Quantitative Data
- In a dataset, quantitative data refers to numerical observations that can often be quantified, analysed, and used mathematically. The population of a nation, a person's height, or a company's quarterly profits are a few examples of quantitative data. 
- Quantitative data might be used to determine seasonal variations in the Air Quality Index (AQI) or calculate the probability of rush hour traffic on an average workday.

##### Qualitative Data
- Data that cannot be measured objectively, such as observations of quantitative data, are known as qualitative data, also known as categorical data. 
A product's or process's quality can often be captured using a variety of subjective data types. 
- Like phone numbers or timestamps, some qualitative data can be numerical but not commonly employed mathematically. Qualitative data includes things like video comments, a car's model, or the colour that your closest friends like best. Qualitative data may be used to find common job application resume keywords.

##### Structured Data
- Data that is organised into rows and columns, with the same set of columns in each row, is known as structured data. Rows hold the actual values, whereas columns indicate a value of a specific type and will be recognised with a label defining what the value represents. 
- In order to guarantee that the values appropriately reflect the column, columns frequently contain a specific set of restrictions or rules on the values. Consider a spreadsheet of customers where each row is required to have a phone number and where the phone digits are never alphabetical. To ensure that the phone number column never contains nothing but numbers, restrictions may be applied to it (phone number column).
- Relating structured data to other structured data is one advantage of structured data organisation. However, since the data is designed to be structured in a particular way, altering its overall structure may require a lot of work. You must plan how you will add these values to the current rows of customers in the dataset, for instance, if you add an email column to the customer spreadsheet that cannot be empty.
- Spreadsheets, relational databases, phone numbers, and bank statements are examples of structured data.

##### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data typically cannot be categorized into rows or columns and doesn't contain a format or set of rules to follow. Because unstructured data has less restrictions on its structure it's easier to add new information in comparison to a structured dataset. If a sensor capturing data on barometric pressure every 2 minutes has received an update that now allows it to measure and record temperature, it doesn't require altering the existing data if it's unstructured. However, this may make analyzing or investigating this type of data take longer. For example, a scientist who wants to find the average temperature of the previous month from the sensors data, but discovers that the sensor recorded an "e" in some of its recorded data to note that it was broken instead of a typical number, which means the data is incomplete.

Examples of unstructured data: text files, text messages, video files

##### Semi-structured
Semi-structured data has features that make it a combination of structured and unstructured data. It doesn't typically conform to a format of rows and columns but is organized in a way that is considered structured and may follow a fixed format or set of rules. The structure will vary between sources, such as a well defined hierarchy to something more flexible that allows for easy integration of new information. Metadata are indicators that help decide how the data is organized and stored and will have various names, based on the type of data. Some common names for metadata are tags, elements, entities and attributes. For example, a typical email message will have a subject, body and a set of recipients and can be organized by whom or when it was sent.

Examples of semi-structured data: HTML, CSV files, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
